# Hairless-Cat-AWS-copy

During Jan - Apr 2022, I enrolled in University of British Columbia as part of my overseas exchange program. I registered myself in the course [CPSC319](https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-319/index.html) during the term and was assigned to a team of 6 to create a Tournament Scheduling Web Application for Amazon. This repository is a copy of the original Hairless-Cat repository. 

It only showcases our final code, but does not showcase our efforts in building this application. The countless issues, pull requests and discussions held on Github/Discord/Google Documents is not seen here, but I hope to showcase a glimpse of our work.

The application is currently not hosted but screenshots can be found in [CPSC 319 User Documentation](sample%20docs/CPSC%20319%20User%20Documentation.pdf). Unfortunately I do not have better images/screenshots as it did not occur to me to take photos of the application. I also didn't get to save our final presentation slides :cry: 

## Documentations

I've included some documentation that my team prepared as part of our course submissions in the folder [`./sample docs`](sample%20docs).

The documents inside are as follows:

- CPSC 319 Project Plan: it outlines how our roles and responsibilites as a team as well as the deadlines we plan to meet for mission success.
- CPSC 319 Design: our design considerations and plans; it includes ER diagrams, sequence diagrams, environment choice writeups.
- CPSC 319 User Documentation: it includes step-by-step instructions, including screenshots of our application, to teach a user on how to use our application.

Documentation regarding our API can be found in [`Hairless-Cat-AWS-Backend-master/docs`](https://github.com/joshtyf/Hairless-Cat-AWS-copy/tree/main/Hairless-Cat-AWS-Backend-master/docs).

## Contributions

I wrote most of the backend Java code. As I was new to Springboot back then, the code might not be optimal or of the best quality. In addition, I also created the CI/CD process using Github Actions for automated deployments to our AWS EC2 instance.
