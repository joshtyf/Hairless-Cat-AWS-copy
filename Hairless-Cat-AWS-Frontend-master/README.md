## Team Organizer

This project aims to develop a cloud based solution to facilitate tournament play.
In order to schedule and administer the events of sporting competition for company staff in Amazon,
 this project will build a solution to allow easy administration of multiple tournaments with the ability
  for employees to self register and share availability based on format of specific tournament.
   The final goal of the project has two aspects. For entrants, it will provide a web-based mobile-friendly application
    that allows users to quickly select from a list of competitions in which to register.
     For administrators, it will provide the system to offer an administrative module to allow administrators
     to organize each tournament. This document will provide details on this project's deliverables, scope,
     and benefits to how the projects will proceed with team structures, efforts/costs, constraints, risks and plans
     for meetings, etc.
